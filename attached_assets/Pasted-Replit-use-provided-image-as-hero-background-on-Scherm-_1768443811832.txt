Replit — use provided image as hero background on “Scherm op locatie” page

Context
The “Scherm op locatie” page has been improved visually, but the hero/header section
must now use a specific image (already added to the project) as its background.

Goal
- Set the provided image as the background of the header/hero section.
- Keep the logo visible.
- Keep all text (H1, subtitle, CTA) readable and premium.
- Work perfectly on desktop and mobile.

Required changes

1) Hero background image
- Use the newly added image file as the background of the hero/header section.
- Apply it via CSS background-image (not <img> tag).
- Use:
  - background-size: cover
  - background-position: center
  - background-repeat: no-repeat
- Ensure the image scales correctly on different screen sizes.

2) Readability overlay (important)
- Add a subtle overlay on top of the background image to ensure text readability.
- Recommended:
  - dark overlay with rgba or gradient (e.g. black at 40–60% opacity)
  - or gradient overlay (darker at top/bottom, lighter in center)
- Do NOT flatten the image completely; it should remain visible and attractive.

3) Text & logo contrast
- Hero title (H1): high contrast (white or near-white).
- Subtitle: slightly softer white/gray.
- CTA button remains clearly visible and on-brand.
- Ensure the logo in the header/navbar remains readable on top of the image:
  - If needed, give the header a semi-transparent background
  - Do NOT hide or shrink the logo.

4) Mobile behavior
- On mobile:
  - Keep the same background image.
  - Ensure text does not overlap awkwardly.
  - Reduce hero height if needed.
- No horizontal scrolling.
- Background image must not crop faces/text awkwardly if visible.

5) Constraints
- Do NOT change copy or routes.
- Do NOT change business logic.
- Only update hero/header styling to use the provided image.

Verification checklist
- Desktop: background image visible, text readable, logo visible.
- Mobile: same background image, good cropping, readable text.
- CTA remains prominent.
