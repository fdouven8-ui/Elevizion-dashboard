You are rebuilding an existing dashboard for a company called Elevizion.
This dashboard is NOT a generic SaaS and NOT meant for multiple external companies.
It is an internal control dashboard for one growing digital signage network.

IMPORTANT GOAL:
Make the system extremely simple to use, highly automated, and scalable,
so the owner needs to do as little manual work as possible.

CURRENT PROBLEM:
The existing dashboard is too complex, too generic, and built like software
for many companies. We need to simplify and refocus it for Elevizion only.

GENERAL RULES:
- Internal dashboard only (no client portal)
- Easy login (admin + future staff roles)
- Max 6 menu items
- Everything should help with overview, automation, and action
- No unnecessary features or SaaS-style overengineering

CORE CONCEPT:
The dashboard connects:
- Yodeck (screens & online/offline status)
- Moneybird (invoices, payments, overdue)
- Internal database (screens, advertisers, ads, placements)

SCREEN_ID is the main unique key (e.g. EVZ-001).
This ID must be used consistently to link Yodeck devices, Moneybird records,
and internal data.

MENU STRUCTURE (REPLACE CURRENT SIDEBAR):

1. Home (Dashboard / Cockpit)
2. Screens
3. Advertisers
4. Placements (Ads on Screens)
5. Finance
6. Settings / Automations

Remove or disable:
- Tasks
- Acquisition
- Generic monitoring
- SaaS-style management sections

---

HOME (MOST IMPORTANT PAGE):

Show at a glance:
- Monthly revenue (current month)
- Open / overdue amount (cash at risk)
- Screens online vs total
- Active advertisers
- Free ad slots (screens with < 20 ads)

Below this, show an automatically generated ACTION LIST:
- Screens offline longer than X hours
- Invoices overdue (grouped by days overdue)
- Ads ending within 14 days
- Screens with empty ad slots

Each action must have 1-click buttons:
- Send WhatsApp / Email (template)
- Pause / Resume ads
- Mark as resolved
- Open related screen / advertiser

---

SCREENS PAGE:

For each screen:
- Screen ID
- Location name
- Online / offline status (from Yodeck)
- Last seen
- Number of active ads
- Monthly revenue for that screen
- Revenue share for location (percentage)

Actions:
- Open in Yodeck
- Log issue
- Contact location

---

ADVERTISERS PAGE:

For each advertiser:
- Name
- Status (active / hold / stopped)
- Payment status from Moneybird (paid / open / overdue)
- Days overdue
- Where ads are running (screens or groups)

Actions:
- Pause / Resume all ads
- Send payment reminder
- Open advertiser details

---

PLACEMENTS PAGE (CORE LOGIC):

Manage which ad runs on which screen:
- Advertiser
- Ad / creative
- Screen or screen group
- Start date / end date
- Monthly price
- Status (active / hold)

This page is the single source of truth for "where does what run".

---

FINANCE PAGE:

Read-only overview from Moneybird:
- Paid invoices
- Open invoices
- Overdue invoices
- Monthly cashflow graph
- Export data (CSV)

---

AUTOMATION SETTINGS (VERY IMPORTANT):

Create toggle-based automation rules:
- Invoice overdue > 3 days → send friendly reminder
- Invoice overdue > 7 days → send reminder + create call task
- Invoice overdue > 14 days → automatically put placements on HOLD
- Screen offline > 60 minutes → create ops alert
- Screen offline > 4 hours → escalate to owner

Owner must be able to turn each rule ON or OFF.

---

ROLES (SIMPLE, FUTURE-PROOF):

- Owner (full access)
- Operations (screens & issues)
- Sales (advertisers & placements)
- Finance (read-only invoices)

No complex permission system.

---

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

- Use existing codebase as base
- Simplify, do not expand unnecessarily
- Data should come from internal database, not live API calls
- Yodeck status via scheduled polling
- Moneybird updates via webhook or polling
- Prepare structure for growth to 100+ screens and 2000+ placements

FINAL GOAL:
This dashboard should feel like an operating system and autopilot
for Elevizion, not like software built for many different companies.
