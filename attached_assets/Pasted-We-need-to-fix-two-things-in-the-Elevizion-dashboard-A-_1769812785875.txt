We need to fix two things in the Elevizion dashboard:

A) UI must be updated to reflect the new simple playlist model.
B) rebuild-playlist must actually add advertiser ads (including auto-upload) even when placements/contracts are empty.

CONTEXT / HARD RULES:
- There is exactly 1 playlist per screen in Yodeck.
- There is 1 BASE playlist in Yodeck (manual “Basis playlist”) which contains the 4 baseline items.
- A screen playlist must be rebuilt by copying all items from the base playlist + then appending advertiser videos.
- now-playing endpoint is READ ONLY and must never create playlists.
- The only mutating endpoint is:
  POST /api/admin/screens/:screenId/rebuild-playlist

A) UI FIX
1) Find the screen detail UI section "Wat draait nu?"
2) Replace any logic that checks old fields (combinedPlaylistId, baselinePlaylistId, adsPlaylistId, playlistId from old model).
3) Use ONLY the now-playing response fields:
   - actualSourceType, actualSourceId, actualSourceName, itemCount, topItems, isCorrect
4) UI rules:
   - if nowPlaying.ok && actualSourceType === "playlist":
       show "Gekoppeld"
       show "Actieve playlist: {actualSourceName} ({actualSourceId})"
       show "Content: {itemCount} items"
       show topItems (first 5)
       show a green badge if isCorrect true else orange with mismatch message
   - else:
       show "Niet gekoppeld" and itemCount=0

B) REBUILD-PLAYLIST MUST ADD ADS
Problem: placements/contracts endpoints are empty in test data, so no ads are being selected. We need a fallback selection model based on targeting, so that advertiser videos get appended.

In the rebuild-playlist service (simplePlaylistModel.ts or the file used by POST /rebuild-playlist):
1) After copying base playlist items, compute candidate advertisers to add:
   - query advertisers where status="active"
   - AND assetStatus IN ("ready_for_yodeck","uploaded","approved")
   - AND (targetRegionCodes includes normalized location city slug OR regionCode OR targetCities includes location.city)
   - normalize: lower-case and trim values; treat location.city "Sittard" as "sittard"
2) For each candidate advertiser:
   - if advertiser.yodeckMediaIdCanonical is null AND advertiser.assetStatus == "ready_for_yodeck":
       call ensureAdvertiserMediaUploaded(advertiserId) which:
         - finds latest uploaded asset file for advertiser
         - uploads to Yodeck using the correct v2 auth header: Authorization: Token <label:apikey>
         - waits/polls for encoding readiness (or at least confirms status ok)
         - stores yodeckMediaIdCanonical on advertiser
   - then append a playlist item using that yodeckMediaIdCanonical
3) Ensure dedupe:
   - do not append an ad if the mediaId is already in the playlist items
4) Enforce capacity:
   - MAX ads per screen = 20 (or configurable)
5) After mutation:
   - push playlist to screen
   - verify now-playing by fetching screen source and confirm it points to the playlistId

Add a rebuild-playlist JSON response with:
- ok
- screenId, playerId
- baseItemsCopiedCount
- adsAddedCount
- adsAdded (array of {advertiserId, mediaId, companyName})
- pushed=true/false
- verify.isCorrect, verify.actualSourceType, verify.actualSourceId

Also add very clear server logs:
[RebuildPlaylist] baseItems=...
[RebuildPlaylist] candidateAds=...
[RebuildPlaylist] uploadedAds=...
[RebuildPlaylist] appendedAds=...
[RebuildPlaylist] pushResult=...
[RebuildPlaylist] verify=...

IMPORTANT:
- Do not reintroduce combined/baseline/ads playlist models.
- Only 1 playlist per screen.
- No other endpoints may create playlists.

Finally:
- ensure AUTOPILOT_BASE_PLAYLIST_ID (or similar env var) is used to read the base playlist items.
- If base playlist has 0 items, rebuild must fail loudly with a clear error.
