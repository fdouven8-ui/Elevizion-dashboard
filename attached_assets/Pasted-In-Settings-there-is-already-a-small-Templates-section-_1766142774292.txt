In Settings there is already a small "Templates" section. Keep that section and its UI style, but expand it into a full Template Center used by the entire dashboard.

GOAL:
All templates used by the system must be managed from this Templates section, while still using Moneybird and the e-sign provider for the actual sending/signing. Do NOT add complex document editors. Keep it simple, editable, and scalable.

1) Template categories (add tabs or dropdown inside the existing Templates page):
A) WhatsApp templates
B) Email templates
C) Contract templates (Advertising Agreement + SEPA mandate/authorization)
D) Quote/Invoice text blocks (email body text, intros/outros, payment instructions)
E) Internal notes/templates (optional): call scripts, follow-up scripts

2) Template structure:
Each template must have:
- name
- category
- subject (for email templates)
- body (text)
- language (optional)
- enabled toggle
- last edited timestamp
- version number (simple increment)
- placeholders list (auto-detect)
- "test render" preview

3) Placeholders:
Support placeholders across all templates, such as:
{{advertiser_name}}, {{contact_name}}, {{phone}}, {{email}}
{{screen_ids}}, {{location_names}}
{{price}}, {{start_date}}, {{end_date}}, {{package_name}}
{{invoice_number}}, {{invoice_amount}}, {{invoice_due_date}}, {{invoice_url}}
{{contract_url}}, {{sepa_url}}

Add a "Preview" mode where the user can select an Advertiser and/or Screen and see the template rendered with real data (no sending, just preview).

4) Where templates are used in the system:
- On Advertiser detail page: buttons "Send WhatsApp", "Send Email" must pick templates from Template Center.
- On onboarding wizards: after creating an advertiser, user can send contract and SEPA using contract templates.
- On payment overdue: automation reminders must use selected templates from Template Center.
- On contract follow-up: reminders must use contract reminder templates.

5) Integration behavior (use external tools, dashboard remains small):
A) Moneybird:
- The dashboard should NOT try to fully recreate Moneybird invoice/quote templates.
- Instead, store and manage:
  - Email text blocks and sending text (intro/outro/payment instructions) in Template Center
  - Which Moneybird document style to use (a selectable "Moneybird document style ID/name" setting)
- When sending an invoice/quote via Moneybird API, use the email text template from Template Center as the message.
- If Moneybird does not support editing invoice/quote layout templates via API, do not build a replacement. Keep it as: choose Moneybird style + send with dashboard email templates.

B) E-sign:
- Contract templates in Template Center define the content/variables OR map to an e-sign provider template ID.
- Store for each contract template:
  - e_sign_template_id (optional)
  - signing order (optional)
  - required documents: Advertising Agreement, SEPA Authorization
- When sending for signature, use the e-sign provider to send and track status (sent/viewed/signed).
- Store signed PDF URL and status in the system.

6) Admin handling and safety:
- Add template permissions: Owner can edit all templates; Sales/Ops can use templates but not edit (optional).
- Add an audit log entry whenever a template is edited or disabled.
- Add "Restore previous version" (keep last 5 versions) OR at minimum keep version history.

7) UI requirements:
- Keep the Templates section compact and consistent with current design.
- Add search + filter by category.
- Add quick buttons:
  - Duplicate template
  - Disable/enable
  - Preview with real advertiser/screen
  - Copy to clipboard (for WhatsApp)

DELIVERABLE:
A more complete Templates Center inside Settings that controls all messaging and document templates used by the dashboard, while still using Moneybird and e-sign for actual invoicing/signing.
