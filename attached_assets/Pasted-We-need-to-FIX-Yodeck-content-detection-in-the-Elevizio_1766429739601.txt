We need to FIX Yodeck content detection in the Elevizion Dashboard.

Current situation:
- We sync screens via GET https://app.yodeck.com/api/v2/screens and store them in DB.
- UI shows “Geen content in Yodeck” because yodeckContentCount stays 0 and yodeckContentSummary is empty, even though the screen is actually playing: news, weather, videos/photos.
- Earlier we saw errors like: “Failed to fetch Yodeck player 591896: 404 Not Found”. This suggests we are calling the wrong Yodeck endpoint and/or using the wrong identifier. In our code we use yodeckPlayerId but Yodeck’s list endpoint returns screens; the id we store (591896) is a SCREEN id, not a “player” resource id.

Goal:
1) Implement a correct “screen content sync” for each Yodeck screen so we can detect what’s assigned/playing.
2) Persist that to these fields in our screens table:
   - yodeckContentCount (number)
   - yodeckContentSummary (json: items[], topItems[], playlists[], lastFetchedAt)
   - yodeckContentLastFetchedAt (timestamp)
3) Control Room logic must use these fields:
   - If contentCount === 0 -> empty_screen (warning) “Geen content in Yodeck”
   - If contentCount > 0 -> screensWithContent++
   - If unknown/unfetched -> content_unknown “sync nodig”
4) Provide solid debug logging in the sync so we can see which Yodeck endpoints return useful data.

Implementation requirements:
A) Stop calling any /players/{id} endpoint. Replace with correct endpoints for screens.
B) Add a Yodeck client function fetchScreenContent(yodeckScreenId, yodeckUuid?) that tries (in this order) and logs status codes + response keys:
   1) GET /api/v2/screens/{id}  (details; often includes assigned layout/playlist info)
   2) GET /api/v2/screens/{id}/schedule (if exists)
   3) GET /api/v2/screens/{id}/playlists (if exists)
   4) GET /api/v2/screens/{id}/media (if exists)
   5) If Yodeck uses UUID endpoints, try the same with {uuid} too.
   Use the first successful response that contains any of: playlist, layout, schedule, media, items.
   If an endpoint returns 404, continue to next.
C) From the successful response, map to a normalized summary:
   - items: array of { type, name, id, duration?, source? }
   - playlists: array of { name, id }
   - topItems: the most frequent/important items (max 5)
   - contentCount: total items (or total media elements) (fallback: if response has no items but has playlist/layout name, set contentCount = 1 and items=[{type:"layout_or_playlist", name:...}])
   - lastFetchedAt: now ISO
D) Update the existing Yodeck sync job so that after fetching the screen list, it loops screens and calls fetchScreenContent for each screen and updates DB fields.
   - Make sure we don’t slow down too much: run with small concurrency (e.g. 3 at a time).
E) Add a manual endpoint:
   - POST /api/integrations/yodeck/sync-content (or extend existing /sync) to re-fetch content for all screens.
F) Update UI texts (Dutch) accordingly:
   - “Content status onbekend (sync nodig)” only when lastFetchedAt is null.
   - “Geen content in Yodeck” only when lastFetchedAt exists AND contentCount === 0.
   - If contentCount > 0 show small summary in Screens page: e.g. “Content: 7 items (Nieuws, Weer, Video…)”.

Deliverables:
- Code changes (backend + any db migration if needed; but fields seem already present).
- Make sure logs clearly show which endpoint succeeded (and which failed with 404).
- After fix, my online screen should no longer show “Geen content in Yodeck” if it actually has content assigned in Yodeck.

IMPORTANT: Do not guess silently. If Yodeck endpoints differ, implement the multi-endpoint “probe” approach above and log the winning endpoint + response keys so we can confirm quickly.
