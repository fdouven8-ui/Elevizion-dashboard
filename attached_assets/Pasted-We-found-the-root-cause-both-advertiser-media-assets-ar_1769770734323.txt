We found the root cause: both advertiser media assets are being REJECTED with rejectReason "Bestand bevat geen video". That means the stored .mp4 files in objstore have NO video stream (likely 0 bytes, truncated, HTML/error page saved, or binary upload bug). Because of this, publish-now fails at RESOLVE_ASSET (no READY_FOR_YODECK asset).

TASK: Make the media pipeline produce forensic diagnostics and harden upload/storage so we never silently store "non-video" files again. Keep all other features working.

A) Add forensic diagnostics to validation results
1) In the validator (the code behind POST /api/admin/media/:id/validate), include in `result`:
   - fileSizeBytes
   - firstBytesHex (first 64 bytes)
   - detectedMime (best effort)
   - isMp4Container (check for "ftyp" box in first bytes)
   - ffprobeJson (if available) OR ffprobeStderr/stdout if ffprobe fails
   - videoStreamCount, audioStreamCount
   - reasonCode machine readable: NO_FILE | EMPTY_FILE | NOT_MP4 | NO_VIDEO_STREAM | FFPROBE_FAILED | CORRUPT_CONTAINER
2) Persist these diagnostics in DB columns (or a JSON column) so later we can inspect per asset without rerunning validation.

B) Harden upload pipeline (most important)
1) In the upload endpoint that stores advertiser videos to objstore:
   - Ensure we stream binary correctly (no text conversion, no utf-8 decoding).
   - After saving, immediately verify:
       - fileSizeBytes > 50KB (configurable)
       - contains "ftyp" within first 16-64 bytes (for mp4/mov)
   - If fails: delete the stored object and mark asset REJECTED with reasonCode EMPTY_FILE/NOT_MP4.
   - Return a clear API error to the user (HTTP 422) with message "Upload is geen geldig videobestand, probeer opnieuw".
2) If the upload is chunked/multipart, ensure the server uses raw buffer/stream and does not JSON parse it.
3) Add logging with correlationId:
   - [Upload] bytesWritten, sha256, firstBytesHex, path
   - [Validate] fileSizeBytes, streams, reasonCode

C) Make normalization conditional
- Only attempt ffmpeg normalization when there is at least 1 video stream.
- If NO_VIDEO_STREAM: do not enqueue normalization; keep REJECTED with diagnostics.

D) Add a simple admin debug endpoint
GET /api/admin/media/:id/diagnostics
Returns the stored diagnostics JSON so we can see exactly what the file is.

ACCEPTANCE
- Re-upload a known good video -> validator shows videoStreamCount=1 and NOT rejected.
- Upload a broken/empty file -> immediate 422 with clear error; nothing stored.
- For the current rejected files, /diagnostics must show fileSizeBytes and firstBytesHex so we can confirm if it was HTML/0 bytes/etc.
Return the file names/functions changed.
