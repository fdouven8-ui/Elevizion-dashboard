We have an existing Elevizion Dashboard (React + TS + Vite frontend, Express backend, Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL). 
Yodeck integration is already working and syncing screens + content summaries. 
DO NOT rebuild the project from scratch. Extend the current integration framework.

Goal: Implement Moneybird integration so I only need to paste my Moneybird API token (personal access token / PAT) and everything else is guided (administration selection, tests, sync).

Current state from logs:
- /api/sync/status returns yodeck connected, moneybird not_configured
- /api/integrations/secrets/status expects moneybird: { access_token: false, admin_id: false }
So build around "access_token + administration_id" and fix any UI label that incorrectly asks for "client_id".

Requirements (step-by-step):
1) Integration settings UI:
   - Replace/avoid asking for "client_id" unless OAuth is explicitly enabled.
   - Default flow must support Moneybird Personal Access Token:
     Fields:
       - moneybird_access_token (required)
       - administration_id (required, but should be selectable)
   - Add a "Connect" / "Test connection" button:
     - Uses access token to call Moneybird API and fetch administrations
     - Show a dropdown to select the administration
     - Save access_token + administration_id securely (use existing encryption/secret storage pattern like Yodeck)

2) Backend:
   - Create Moneybird client wrapper with base URL, Authorization Bearer token, error handling, rate limit friendly retries (simple backoff).
   - Endpoints:
     - GET /api/integrations/moneybird/admins  -> returns administrations list (id + name)
     - POST /api/integrations/moneybird/test   -> validates token + administration_id
     - POST /api/sync/moneybird/run            -> manual sync trigger
   - Scheduled sync:
     - If configured, run every 15 minutes like Yodeck sync
     - If not configured, keep current behavior: "[Moneybird Sync] Skipped - not configured"

3) Data model & mapping (CRITICAL):
   - Do not break existing tables. Add minimal new tables/columns.
   - Store and link:
     - Moneybird contacts (at least id, company_name/name, email, updated_at)
     - Invoices (id, contact_id, state, total, due_date, pdf_url if available, updated_at)
     - Optional: subscriptions/contracts if used in Moneybird
   - Add linkage so Yodeck + Moneybird data can be connected:
     - Our core identifier across the app is SCREEN_ID (EVZ-001 format) OR existing screenId.
     - Each advertiser/customer in our system should be linkable to a Moneybird contact:
       Add fields like advertisers.moneybird_contact_id (nullable) and/or locations.moneybird_contact_id.
     - Each contract/invoice in our system should be linkable to a Moneybird invoice:
       Add fields like invoices.moneybird_invoice_id (nullable).
   - Create a UI mapping screen:
     - Show list of internal Advertisers/Locations and allow selecting a Moneybird Contact to link (autocomplete/search).
     - After linking, finance views should be able to show moneybird invoice status per advertiser.

4) Sync logic:
   - On sync: pull Moneybird contacts + invoices (at least recent 90 days or updated_since).
   - Upsert into DB.
   - Compute KPIs:
     - unpaidInvoiceCount + unpaidAmount
     - overdue list for /api/finance/overdue
   - Make sure API responses used by the dashboard (e.g., /api/dashboard/kpis) incorporate Moneybird data once configured.

5) DX / Setup:
   - Add env var support for token in dev, but store encrypted in DB for production.
   - Add clear logs:
     - [Moneybird] Connected (administration: X)
     - [Moneybird Sync] fetched contacts=N invoices=N updated=N
     - Log 401/403 as "token invalid" not generic error

Deliverables:
- Working Moneybird PAT integration without requiring OAuth client_id.
- Minimal changes, extend existing codebase.
- Yodeck + Moneybird are linkable through advertiser/location and invoice relationships, so we can later correlate “which ads/screens belong to which paying customer”.
