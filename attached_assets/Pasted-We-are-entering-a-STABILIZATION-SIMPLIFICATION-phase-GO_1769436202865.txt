We are entering a STABILIZATION & SIMPLIFICATION phase.

GOAL
There must be exactly ONE source of truth for screen state, layout state, and playlist state.
No duplicate logic, no parallel flows, no legacy inputs, no alternative paths.

RULES (HARD)
1. screen_content (Yodeck v2) is the ONLY valid source of truth.
2. Legacy fields (default_playlist, default_playlist_type, mode flags, etc.) must NOT be used anywhere except as fallback inside low-level Yodeck API adapters.
3. UI, DB, Admin pages, Debug pages, and background jobs must ALL reflect the same truth.

TASKS

A) INVENTORY & REMOVE
- Scan the entire codebase and identify:
  - Duplicate screen state logic
  - Legacy playlist/layout detection
  - Multiple ways of determining "mode", "layout", or "playlist"
- REMOVE any logic that:
  - Is not using screen_content.source_type / source_id / source_name
  - Is only used by old flows or debug experiments
- If a feature/page does not add operational value → delete it.

B) DEFINE SINGLE CANONICAL MODEL
Create ONE canonical screen status model, e.g.:

{
  screenId,
  sourceType: "layout" | "playlist" | "unknown",
  sourceId,
  sourceName,
  isElevizion,
  onlineStatus
}

- All pages must consume THIS model.
- No page may re-interpret Yodeck responses on its own.

C) MENU & PAGE CLEANUP
Based on the sidebar (Home, Onboarding, Schermen, Adverteerders, Plaatsingen, Financieel, Admin items):

- Remove pages that:
  - Duplicate functionality of Yodeck Debug
  - Show partial or derived state that can go out of sync
- Ensure:
  - Schermen shows EXACTLY what Yodeck Debug shows (same data source)
  - Layouts page is READ-ONLY (creation is system-managed)
  - No menu item performs destructive actions except via controlled flows

D) LOCK FLOWS
- There must be exactly ONE way to:
  - Reset a screen
  - Apply an Elevizion layout
  - Verify screen state
- That way = the hardened Force Elevizion Layout flow.
- All other buttons/paths must be removed or disabled.

E) CONSISTENCY GUARANTEE
- If two pages show the same concept (e.g. screen mode), they must:
  - Use the same backend function
  - Use the same DTO
  - Show the same value or the page should not exist

F) FAIL FAST
- If screen_content cannot be read → show "UNKNOWN" everywhere.
- NEVER guess.
- NEVER infer.
- NEVER silently fall back.

DELIVERABLE
- A cleaner codebase with fewer files, fewer flags, fewer conditionals.
- Sidebar only contains pages that reflect operational reality.
- No feature should be explainable as "debug-only" or "legacy".
- The system should feel boring, predictable, and impossible to misuse.

IMPORTANT
If something is not clearly needed for:
- onboarding a location
- publishing ads
- verifying screens
THEN IT MUST GO.

Proceed carefully, delete aggressively, and keep the system minimal.
