We have a real blocking bug in Yodeck playlist creation.

Evidence (from /admin/yodeck-debug):
HTTP 400 {"error":{"code":"missing_key_generic","message":"Invalid request input","details":{"missing_key":"items"}}}
This happens when creating the baseline playlist ("Baseline | Bouwservice Douven").

Fix requirement:
Yodeck POST /api/v2/playlists requires the "items" field in the request body. Even when we want an empty playlist, we MUST send items: [].

Implement the fix everywhere we create playlists:
1) Baseline playlist creation (ensureBaselinePlaylist / ensureBaselinePlaylistId / createBaselinePlaylist).
2) Any other playlist creation in the codebase (ads playlist, fallback schedule playlist, tag-based playlist, etc.) that uses POST /api/v2/playlists.

Exact change:
When calling POST https://app.yodeck.com/api/v2/playlists, always send a body like:
{
  "name": "<playlist name>",
  "description": "<optional>",
  "workspace": { "id": <workspaceId> } OR { "name": "<workspaceName>" } (keep what we already use),
  "items": [],
  "add_gaps": false,
  "shuffle_content": false
}
Important: do NOT omit "items" ever.

Also fix defensive behavior:
- If we already have the playlist, do not recreate it.
- If we create it successfully, store playlistId in DB for the location.
- Log clearly:
  - "Creating playlist ... payload includes items: []"
  - On error, include status code + response body.

After fixing playlist creation, re-run the Force flow:
- /api/admin/layouts/:id/force OR the Force Elevizion Layout button
It must no longer fail at "Creating baseline playlist".

Acceptance criteria:
- Clicking "Force Elevizion Layout op dit Scherm" completes without 400 errors.
- Baseline playlist gets created successfully in Yodeck.
- Baseline seeding can add the placeholder media to that playlist (if implemented).
- The debug page should show mode/layout status without "unknown" once sync runs.
- Add a minimal unit/integration test (or a mock) that verifies POST /playlists payload always includes items: [].

Search the codebase for any POST to "/api/v2/playlists" and patch all of them consistently.
Do not remove or revert existing layout/tag logic; only fix playlist creation + logging/tests.
