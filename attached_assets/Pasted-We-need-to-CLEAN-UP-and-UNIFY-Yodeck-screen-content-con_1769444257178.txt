We need to CLEAN UP and UNIFY Yodeck screen content control so every screen is driven the same way and the UI shows one truth.

GOAL (Canonical Model)
Each location must always have exactly:
- BASE playlist (always-on): news/weather/clock + elevizion baseline media (never empty)
- ADS playlist: elevizion self-ad + paid ads (never "Test", never empty in production)
Each screen must use the Elevizion 2-zone layout:
- BASE zone uses BASE playlist
- ADS zone uses ADS playlist
Only these two playlists matter. Remove/disable all legacy inputs that can change screen content in other ways.

PROBLEMS OBSERVED
- Screen is on Elevizion layout, but BASE playlist has 0 items and ADS playlist is still old "Test".
- Debug UI shows inconsistent playlist item count (badge says 6, list shows "Geen items") => mapper/UI is out of sync.
- Some screens show old demo content because playlists behind the layout are wrong or empty.

TASKS (Implement all):

A) Canonical playlist naming + ownership
For every location, enforce deterministic names and store IDs in DB:
- basePlaylistName = `Baseline | <locationName>`
- adsPlaylistName  = `Ads | <locationName>`
If an existing playlist is named "Test" or contains "auto-playlist" for a linked location, it is NOT canonical.
Create/fetch canonical playlists and update DB to point to them.

B) Playlist creation + items (Yodeck API v2)
Ensure POST /api/v2/playlists includes required `items: []` always.
Implement a robust playlist items layer:
- getPlaylistItems(playlistId) -> returns normalized items array (supports both Yodeck item shapes)
- setPlaylistItems(playlistId, items) -> replaces playlist items with exact list (idempotent)
- appendPlaylistItemIfMissing(playlistId, mediaId, duration?) -> idempotent
Also add `POST /screens/:id/push/` after changes.

C) Baseline seeding (BASE must never be empty)
Make BASE playlist always contain at minimum:
1) baseline placeholder media (elevizion-baseline-1080p.png) OR fallback to an existing "Elevizion Baseline" media if already uploaded.
2) If we want dynamic news/weather later, keep it optional behind a feature flag, but BASE must have at least 1 item always.
If baseline media upload fails, log the exact endpoint used and error body.

D) Ads seeding (ADS must never be "Test")
For ADS playlist, ensure at minimum:
1) Elevizion self-ad media item (use existing media by tag or name, otherwise create a placeholder "Elevizion Ad Placeholder" image/video)
Paid ads are added later by placement engine, but ADS must not be empty.

E) Layout binding must use the canonical playlists
When creating or verifying the Elevizion layout regions, ensure:
- BASE region is bound to basePlaylistId
- ADS region is bound to adsPlaylistId
Fix region payload to include all required v2 fields (top, left, zindex, duration, res_width, res_height, order, etc.)
Add verifyLayoutBindings(layoutId, basePlaylistId, adsPlaylistId) and auto-fix if mismatch.

F) One single control path (remove legacy paths)
Audit UI + API:
- Remove/hide any UI controls that allow choosing Playlist/Media/App/Schedule directly for a linked screen.
- DISABLE_LEGACY_SCREEN_CONTENT_UI = true by default for admins too, except yodeck-debug.
All screen operations must go through yodeckScreenContentService canonical functions:
- ensureCompliance(locationId) => creates playlists, seeds items, ensures layout exists + correct bindings, assigns layout to screen, pushes, verifies.
- forceReset(locationId) => assigns a dedicated reset playlist "Elevizion | EMPTY (reset)" and pushes.
- pushNow(locationId)

G) Fix Debug UI inconsistency
The debug page currently shows ADS playlist badge "6 items" but list says "Geen items".
Make the debug UI use ONLY the normalized playlist items returned from getPlaylistItems().
The count must be derived from the same array used to render the list.
If items cannot be fetched, show an error banner with the raw HTTP status.

H) Migration + Safety
Add a one-time migration job or admin endpoint:
POST /api/admin/yodeck/migrate-canonical
- loops over all linked locations
- runs ensureCompliance(locationId)
- logs per location: oldBasePlaylistId, oldAdsPlaylistId, newBasePlaylistId, newAdsPlaylistId, layoutId, push status, verify status.
Do NOT delete old playlists automatically. Just stop using them.

I) Acceptance criteria
For the screenshot case (screenId 591896 / location Bouwservice Douven):
- Live status shows LAYOUT and Elevizion true
- BASE playlist shows >= 1 item (baseline)
- ADS playlist shows >= 1 item (self-ad placeholder)
- Screen playback now shows split BASE+ADS correctly
- No "Test" playlist is used for linked screens.

Implement with clear logs and minimal new UI. Keep it robust and idempotent.
