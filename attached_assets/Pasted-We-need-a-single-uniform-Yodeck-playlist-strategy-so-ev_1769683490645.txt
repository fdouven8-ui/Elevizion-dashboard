We need a single uniform Yodeck playlist strategy so every screen always plays baseline content and never ends up empty.

CURRENT PROBLEM:
- Screen "Test" plays playlist "Elevizion | Screen | 591896" and has baseline items, works.
- Screen "Basil's Barber Shop Maasbracht" plays playlist "Elevizion | Loop | YDK-591895" and shows "No content to play".
We must eliminate multiple playlist naming/flows. Every screen (old + new) must get the same canonical playlist, auto-created, auto-seeded, auto-assigned.

GOAL:
For every Yodeck screen, the device must always have exactly ONE assigned playback playlist:
Canonical playlist name: "Elevizion | Screen | {yodeckPlayerId}"
Example: "Elevizion | Screen | 591895"
This playlist must always contain baseline media items (news/weather/self promo/etc) so it can never be empty.
Ads are appended later, but baseline stays.

IMPLEMENT:
1) Create a single function ensureCanonicalScreenPlayback(screen):
   - Input: local Screen record with yodeckPlayerId and yodeckUuid
   - Compute canonicalName = `Elevizion | Screen | ${yodeckPlayerId}`
   - Find playlist by exact name. If multiple exist, pick the newest and mark others as legacy (rename with prefix "LEGACY ").
   - If missing, create playlist in Yodeck, store playlistId + playlistName on Screen record.
   - Ensure playlist has baseline items (seed if < MIN_BASELINE_COUNT).
     Baseline items are the existing Yodeck media IDs used on the working screen (NOS, Weer, 1Limburg etc). Put these IDs in config and verify they exist.
   - Assign this playlist to the screen as Screen Content (source_type=playlist, source_id=playlistId).
   - Verify by calling now-playing endpoint: actualSourceId must equal playlistId.
   - Return a structured result with {ok, selfHealed, actions[], errors[]}.

2) Add "repair all screens" job:
   - Admin endpoint: POST /api/admin/yodeck/repair-all-screens
   - Loops all screens with yodeckPlayerId present:
     run ensureCanonicalScreenPlayback(screen)
   - Summary output: total, repairedCount, alreadyOkCount, failedCount with per-screen errors.

3) Fix scheduled sync bug:
   - When fetching Yodeck screen list, if response is not JSON (content-type text/html or body starts with "<"):
     log status + content-type + first 200 chars
     set yodeckSyncError = "Yodeck API returned HTML (auth/endpoint/blocked)"
     do NOT treat it as empty screens list.
   - Ensure we use the correct Yodeck API base URL and token header.
   - Make /api/admin/integrations/yodeck/test return a clear diagnostic.

4) Acceptance criteria:
   - Both screens (591896 and 591895) end up with assigned playlist "Elevizion | Screen | {id}".
   - Neither screen ever shows "No content to play".
   - There are no "Loop | YDK-..." playlists assigned to screens anymore.
   - Running repair-all-screens multiple times is idempotent (no duplicates, no re-adding baseline endlessly).
