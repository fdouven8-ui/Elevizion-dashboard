Replit — Add admin-only “Test upload” shortcut to jump directly to video upload (TEST_MODE only)

Problem
In TEST_MODE the flow works, but testing is slow because you must complete all onboarding steps.
We need a fast way to start testing from the upload video step.

Goal
Allow Frank (admin) to jump directly to the upload video portal in TEST_MODE, without completing prior steps each time.
This must be admin-only and disabled in real production mode.

Requirements

1) Add admin action: “Test upload” (button)
Add a button in the admin UI:
- On Advertiser detail page AND/OR in a new “Test tools” section.
Label: “Test upload (direct)”
Visible only when:
- isAdmin === true AND isTestMode() === true

2) What the button does
When clicked:
- Create (or reuse) an upload token for that advertiser:
  - type: "upload"
  - advertiserId: <selected advertiser>
  - TTL = getTokenTtlDays() (30 days in test mode)
  - mark active/not used
- Return the full upload URL and copy to clipboard
- Also provide a “Open upload” link/button that opens it in a new tab immediately.

3) Optional: No advertiser selected? Provide default
If you add it as a global test tool (not tied to an advertiser):
- Create a “Test advertiser” record if none exists
  name: “TEST — Upload”
  email: “test@elevizion.local”
- Then generate token for that advertiser and redirect to upload page.

4) Provide a direct route for admins (optional convenience)
Add an admin-only route:
- GET /admin/test/upload
Behavior:
- Requires admin session AND isTestMode()
- Generates a token for the most recent advertiser (or the test advertiser)
- Redirects (302) directly to /upload/<token>
This gives one-click testing from the browser.

5) Security constraints (must)
- These shortcuts must be blocked unless:
  - admin authenticated AND isTestMode() === true
- If not allowed, return 404 (not 403) to avoid discovery.
- Do not expose the shortcut on public marketing pages.

Acceptance criteria
- In TEST_MODE, admin can click “Test upload (direct)” and immediately land on the upload portal.
- Upload portal behaves exactly the same as in real onboarding (same validation, storage, linking).
- In production with TEST_MODE off, the shortcut is unavailable and routes are not accessible.
