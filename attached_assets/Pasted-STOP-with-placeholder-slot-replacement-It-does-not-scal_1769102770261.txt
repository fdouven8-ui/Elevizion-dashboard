STOP with placeholder slot replacement. It does not scale (100s of screens).
We must eliminate any requirement to manually create items in playlists.

TASK: Remove placeholder logic and implement scalable publishing via TAG-BASED playlists.

1) Delete/disable placeholder replacement code paths completely.
- No ELEVIZION_SLOT detection.
- No requirement to pre-create items.
- If playlist item create endpoint doesn't exist, we DO NOT fallback to placeholders.

2) Implement Tag-based playlists approach:
- For each location (screen location), define a unique tag:
  playlistTag = `elevizion:location:${locationId}`
- Publishing an ad to a location = tagging the media with playlistTag.
- Therefore, publish flow becomes:
  a) two-step upload (already works)
  b) update media tags to include:
     - `elevizion:ad`
     - `elevizion:advertiser:${advertiserId}`
     - `elevizion:plan:${planId}`
     - for each approved target: playlistTag
  c) mark placement/plan as PUBLISHED if tagging succeeded

3) Implement "update media tags" API call to Yodeck:
- Try the correct endpoint by probing in code (one-time):
  A) PATCH `${BASE}/media/${mediaId}` body: { tags: [...] }
  B) PUT   `${BASE}/media/${mediaId}` body: { tags: [...] }
  C) PATCH `${BASE}/media/${mediaId}` body: { tag_names: [...] }
  D) If Yodeck returns the media object, detect which field holds tags and use that format.
- Always log: MEDIA_TAG_UPDATE url=... status=... content-type=... bodySnippet=...

4) Ensure each location uses a tag-based playlist in Yodeck:
- Add a field in DB: location.playlistMode = "TAG_BASED" | "CLASSIC"
- Default new locations to TAG_BASED.
- For existing locations:
  - Add an admin UI field to store playlistTag and playlistMode.
  - If playlistMode is CLASSIC, show a warning: "Classic playlists require manual item management, not supported for scale."

5) Optional: create tag-based playlist via API (if possible)
- Try to create playlist via API only if endpoint exists; otherwise, user creates 1 playlist per location once.
- This is acceptable: one-time per location, not per ad.

6) Status & errors
- If tag update fails:
  lastErrorCode = "YODECK_MEDIA_TAG_UPDATE_FAILED"
- If tag update succeeds:
  plan.status = PUBLISHED, publishedAt set, failedAt cleared
- Stop leaving lastErrorCode stuck on YODECK_UPLOAD_FAILED.

ACCEPTANCE:
- Publishing never calls playlist update or playlist item create.
- No placeholder setup needed.
- Publish succeeds by tagging media for the target location(s).
