We have a bug in Yodeck content sync caching.

Symptom:
After a successful sync we have correct yodeckContentSummary + mediaItems saved on screens and control-room/actions shows contentCount, adsCount/nonAdsCount etc.
But on later sync runs the logs show:
- "[YodeckContent] Sync complete: 2 screens (2 cached)"
- response has "skipped": 2
- "[YodeckContent] Totals: 0 unique media, 0 total assignments"

So when cache is used, we incorrectly skip aggregation/totals and possibly skip DB updates / response population.

TASK:
Fix the caching logic so that cached results are treated as full results:
1) When a screen uses cached content, still include its contentSummary (including mediaItems, mediaIds, sourceType/sourceName, lastFetchedAt, uniqueMediaCount) in the per-screen results array used for:
   - returning API response
   - calculating totals (unique media, total assignments)
   - calculating ads/non_ads stats (adsTotal, nonAdsTotal, adsUnlinked)
2) Totals must be computed from ALL processed screens (cached + freshly fetched). "skipped" should only mean "not fetched from Yodeck this run", NOT "excluded from totals".
3) Ensure the DB screen record keeps correct:
   - yodeckContentStatus
   - yodeckContentCount
   - yodeckContentSummary
   - yodeckContentLastFetchedAt
   even on cached runs (either no-op update is fine, but the returned data + totals must remain correct).
4) Ensure control-room stats and actions keep showing:
   - contentCount, topItems
   - adsCount, nonAdsCount, adsUnlinkedCount
   - topAds/topNonAds
   - mediaItems with category: "ad" or "non_ad"
5) Keep Moneybird disabled for now. Do NOT require any env secrets for Yodeck (API key comes from integrations.encryptedCredentials). No new config UI required.

Implementation guidance:
- Identify the function that does the Yodeck content detail sync (likely something like syncAllScreensContent / fetchYodeckContentForScreen / caching block).
- The cache should return a normalized object with the same shape as fresh fetch result (e.g. { ok, screenId, contentSummary, mediaItems, counts, adsCount, nonAdsCount, ... }).
- When cache-hit: push that normalized result into the results list and add its mediaIds/mediaItems into aggregation sets/counters.
- Only increment skipped counter; do not bypass aggregation or totals.
- Add a unit-style console log to confirm: when 2 cached screens, Totals still show 6 unique media and 12 total assignments (based on current sample).

After code changes:
- Run /api/integrations/yodeck/sync twice and confirm the second run (cached) still returns non-zero totals and the dashboard still shows correct content + ad/non-ad counts.

Please implement the fix, point me to the modified files, and include the key code diff sections.
