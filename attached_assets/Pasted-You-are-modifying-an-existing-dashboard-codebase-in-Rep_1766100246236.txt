You are modifying an existing dashboard codebase in Replit.
Rebuild it into an Elevizion-specific internal control room.
This is NOT a generic SaaS and NOT for multiple external companies.
It is built for Elevizion only.

TOP PRIORITY (OPS-FIRST):
1) Screen uptime & reliability
2) Correct ad delivery (what runs where)
3) Fast onboarding (new screen + new advertiser + new creative)
4) Simple automation (alerts, checklists, templates)
Finance/revenue is secondary in V1 (still present, but not the main cockpit focus).

KEEP:
- Yodeck integration for device status (online/offline, last seen)
- Moneybird integration ONLY for payment status (paid/open/overdue) in V1
- Clean modern UI (simple, clear, fast)
- Scalable structure for 100+ screens and 2000+ placements

REMOVE / SIMPLIFY:
- Any generic “multi-company SaaS” setup
- Complex admin/management sections
- Acquisition/task modules not directly supporting onboarding & operations
- Excessive menus

NAVIGATION (MAX 6):
1) Home (Control Room)
2) Onboarding
3) Screens
4) Ads & Placements
5) Advertisers
6) Settings (includes Templates + Automations + Users) + Finance tab inside Settings

CORE RULE:
SCREEN_ID like EVZ-001 is mandatory and used everywhere.
Yodeck device must include SCREEN_ID in name/tag.
Moneybird contact/note should store SCREEN_ID if it is a location host.
All matching uses SCREEN_ID.

DATA MODEL (minimum required):
- Users (Owner, Ops, Sales, Finance-lite) simple RBAC
- Locations (host businesses, contacts, revenue_share_percent optional)
- Screens (screen_id, location_id, yodeck_device_id, online_status, last_seen)
- Advertisers (name, contact info, moneybird_contact_id, status)
- Creatives (advertiser_id, file_url, type, duration, approval_status)
- Placements (creative_id -> screen_id or group, start/end, status active/hold, priority/order)
- ScreenGroups (optional but recommended)
- Issues (screen_id, type, severity, status, assignee, notes)
- AuditLog (important actions only)
- SyncLog (yodeck polling runs, moneybird sync runs)

HOME (CONTROL ROOM) — MUST BE OPS-FIRST:
Top tiles:
- Screens Online / Total
- Offline Screens (count)
- Ads Live Today (count of active placements)
- Screens With Empty Slots (<20 placements)
- Issues Open (count)
- Payment Risk (count overdue advertisers) — SECONDARY, small tile

Below: 3 sections

A) ALERTS (auto-generated, highest priority)
- Offline screen > 30 min
- Offline screen > 2 hours
- Screen never seen (new screen not reporting)
- Screens with empty inventory (<20 placements)
- Creative expiring or placement ending in 7/14 days
Each alert has one-click actions:
- Open Screen
- Create Issue
- Mark Resolved
- Copy WhatsApp template (prefilled)

B) TODAY’S CHECKLIST (owner-friendly)
- “Confirm all screens online”
- “Fill empty screens”
- “Approve pending creatives”
- “Renew expiring placements”
Checklist items deep-link to the exact page/filtered view.

C) QUICK GRAPHS (ops graphs, not revenue graphs)
- Offline incidents last 7 days (bar)
- Online percentage trend (line)
- Empty inventory count trend (line)
Revenue/cash graphs are optional and moved to Settings/Finance.

ONBOARDING — MUST BE FAST & GUIDED (WIZARDS)
Create 3 onboarding flows:

1) New Screen Wizard
Step 1: Create/select Location (name, address, contact, phone/email)
Step 2: Generate screen_id (EVZ-###) + display clear instruction:
        “Set Yodeck device name/tag to include EVZ-###”
Step 3: Link Yodeck device (select from fetched devices OR paste device id)
Step 4: Validate: show online/offline + last_seen
Step 5: Add to group (optional)
Finish: show “Screen added & monitored” + button “Add placements now”

2) New Advertiser Wizard
Step 1: advertiser details
Step 2: link Moneybird contact (search/select) or mark “link later”
Step 3: choose package fields (monthly price optional) BUT do not make finance required
Step 4: next wizard: add creative + placements
Finish: show “Advertiser created” + button “Upload creative”

3) New Ad (Creative) + Placement Wizard (MOST USED)
Step 1: upload creative (image/video/html), set duration
Step 2: approve status (pending -> approve)
Step 3: choose screens or group, set start/end, status active
Step 4: show summary “Now running on: EVZ-001, EVZ-014 …”
Finish: button “Preview placements” (filtered view)

SCREENS PAGE (Ops view):
Table with filters/search:
- online/offline, group, empty inventory, location
Columns:
- screen_id, location, status, last_seen, active placements count, empty slots count
Actions:
- Open in Yodeck (link)
- Create Issue
- Copy Location WhatsApp template
- Add placements shortcut

ADS & PLACEMENTS PAGE (single source of truth):
- Manage placements (create/edit/pause/hold)
- Bulk actions: assign to group, pause/resume, change dates
- Warnings: expired, missing creative, screen offline
- “Where does what run” view:
   Filter by advertiser OR by screen_id

ADVERTISERS PAGE:
- status, creatives count, active placements count
- payment status indicator (paid/open/overdue) as secondary
Actions:
- Open advertiser
- See where ads run
- Copy reminder template (if overdue)

SETTINGS (Owner control):
Tabs:
- Automations (toggles + thresholds)
- Templates (WhatsApp/email scripts, editable)
- Users (simple: add/disable, role)
- Integrations (API keys in env, sync status)
- Finance (secondary): show overdue list + export, nothing fancy in V1

AUTOMATIONS (OPS-FIRST):
Toggles:
- Offline > 30 min => create Issue
- Offline > 2 hours => escalate alert to Owner
- Empty inventory (<20) => alert + checklist item
- Placement ending in 14 days => alert
Payment automations are optional in V1:
- Overdue > 14 days => set placements HOLD (toggle OFF by default)

INTEGRATIONS:
- Poll Yodeck every 5-10 minutes and store to DB
- Sync Moneybird status periodically or via webhook
- UI reads from DB (fast), not live API calls

SECURITY & RELIABILITY (must implement):
- Password hashing (bcrypt/argon2)
- Session cookies httpOnly, secure
- Server-side authorization checks per role
- Input validation everywhere
- Rate limit login
- Audit log for: login, onboarding create, placement changes, hold/pause, settings edits
- Sync error handling: never crash UI; show “sync health” widget and log errors

DOCUMENTATION (must add):
- In-app Help page: “How to add screen”, “How to add advertiser”, “How to upload ad & place it”, “What alerts mean”
- Repo README: setup, env vars, how polling works, troubleshooting

IMPLEMENTATION ORDER (important):
1) Simplify navigation + build Home (ops-first)
2) Build Onboarding wizards
3) Build Screens table + Placements truth view + bulk actions
4) Add Issues
5) Add integrations + sync jobs + sync health
6) Add security hardening + audit logs + docs
