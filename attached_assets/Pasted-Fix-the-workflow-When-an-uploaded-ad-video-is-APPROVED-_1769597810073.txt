Fix the workflow: When an uploaded ad video is APPROVED by me, it must automatically result in a placement and be published to screens. Right now the UI shows "Niet gekoppeld — Geen plaatsing" even though the asset is approved. That means we are missing the auto-placement step.

GOAL
APPROVE = automatically create placements + publish, without me manually adding placements.

CURRENT STATE
- Ad asset exists and is APPROVED (uploaded via portal and approved)
- Content tab shows the asset, but status says "Geen plaatsing"
- Per-screen playlist shows 0 items and screen plays nothing

IMPLEMENT THIS AUTOMATION

1) On adAsset approval event:
- Create or update an AutoPlacementPlan for that advertiser/contract:
  - Determine target screens using the existing rules (contract/package/region/cities)
  - If no targets are selected/available, use a safe fallback for TESTING:
    - If advertiser is internal/test OR there is exactly 1 screen in the system, place on that screen
    - Otherwise put into WAITING with a clear reason

2) Create Placement records:
- For each target screen create a placement row linking:
  adAssetId + screenId + contractId (+ startDate)
- Mark placement ACTIVE
- Ensure idempotency: approving twice must not create duplicates

3) Publish immediately:
- After creating placements, run:
  ensureScreenPlaylist(screenId) -> include baseline + ads from placements
  assignAndPushScreenContent(screenId, playlistId)
  verify screen content points to playlist and playlist itemCount > 0

4) UI changes:
- Replace "Geen plaatsing" with:
  - "Wordt geplaatst…" right after approval (while publish runs)
  - Then "Gekoppeld" once placement exists and playlist contains it
- In Plaatsingen tab: the placement should appear automatically after approval.
- In "Wat draait nu?": items count must become > 0 (baseline at least) and ads count must reflect the new placement.

ACCEPTANCE
- I approve an uploaded video and within the same flow it becomes LIVE on the target screen(s) without manual steps.
- The ad no longer shows "Geen plaatsing".
