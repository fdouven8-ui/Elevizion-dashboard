Refactor authentication and user management to a simple admin-managed username + password system.
Do NOT auto-create users on login. Users must be created by an admin inside Settings.

1) Login method:
- Login must be ONLY: username + password
- Remove login via email magic links, SSO, or “auto-added after login”
- Username must be unique and not an email requirement (email optional field)

2) User creation & management (Settings > Gebruikers):
Admin (role: Eigenaar) can:
- Create a new user with:
  - username (required, unique)
  - display name (optional)
  - password (required at creation OR “send temporary password”)
  - status: active / disabled
- Reset password (generate temporary password)
- Force password change on next login (toggle)
- Disable/enable user
- Delete user (optional, or soft-delete)

3) Permissions (simple checkboxes):
Replace complex roles with a small set of permission presets + custom checkboxes.

A) Presets (one click):
- Eigenaar (full access)
- Operatie (Screens + Placements)
- Sales (Advertisers + Placements)
- Finance (Finance read-only)
- Read-only (view only)

B) Custom permissions (checkboxes):
- View Screens
- Edit Screens
- View Advertisers
- Edit Advertisers
- View Placements
- Edit Placements
- View Finance
- Edit Settings (only owner by default)
- Manage Users (only owner by default)

Preset selection should auto-check the boxes, but admin can adjust manually.

4) Access enforcement:
- Enforce permissions server-side on every route/API.
- Hide menu items the user does not have access to.
- If a user navigates directly to a forbidden page, show “Geen toegang”.

5) UX requirements:
- User list must be easy to manage:
  - table with username, name, role/preset, status, last login
  - quick actions: reset password, disable, edit permissions
- Keep it clean and fast; no over-engineering.

6) Security:
- Store passwords hashed (bcrypt or argon2)
- Rate limit login attempts
- Use secure sessions (httpOnly cookies)
- Audit log: user created/disabled/password reset/permission change

Goal:
Classic business login and easy user administration:
Admin creates accounts, assigns simple access, and manages everything from Settings.
