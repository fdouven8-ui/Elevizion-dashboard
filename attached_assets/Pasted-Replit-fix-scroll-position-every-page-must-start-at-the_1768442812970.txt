Replit — fix scroll position: every page must start at the TOP (no scroll retention)

Problem
When opening/navigating to a new page, the view starts near the bottom instead of at the top.
This must be fixed globally for all routes and also for step-to-step navigation in the flow.

Goal
On every route change (and step change), force the scroll position to:
top = 0, left = 0
So the user always lands at the top of the page.

Implementation (do this robustly)

1) Add a global ScrollToTop component
- Create `client/src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx` (or similar)
- Use the router’s location/pathname hook (React Router: `useLocation()`).
- On pathname change, run:
  - `window.scrollTo({ top: 0, left: 0, behavior: "auto" })`
  - Also set `document.documentElement.scrollTop = 0` and `document.body.scrollTop = 0` as fallback.

2) Mount it once at the app root
- Insert <ScrollToTop /> inside the Router, above Routes, so it runs for every navigation.
- If using nested routers/layouts, ensure it is in the highest-level layout that wraps all pages.

3) Disable browser scroll restoration (prevents back/forward weirdness)
- In a top-level effect (e.g. App.tsx), set:
  - `if ("scrollRestoration" in window.history) window.history.scrollRestoration = "manual";`

4) Also handle “same route, content changes” (wizard steps)
If the start flow changes “step” via state or query param without changing pathname:
- Add a second effect in the flow page (Start.tsx) that scrolls to top when `step` changes.
- Only do this for the flow (not global) if step changes don’t trigger a pathname change.

5) Fix any layout/container that forces scroll to bottom
- Check if any container uses:
  - `scrollIntoView()`
  - `element.focus()` on a field near bottom
  - `flex` + `justify-end`
  - `overflow-auto` with preserved scrollTop
If found, remove/adjust so it doesn’t auto-scroll to the bottom on mount.

Acceptance criteria
- Opening any route always starts at the top.
- Clicking menu links always starts at the top.
- Clicking “Volgende” in the flow always starts at the top of the next step.
- Works on desktop and mobile.
- Back/forward doesn’t jump to weird positions.

Constraints
- No redesign, logic-only fix.
- Keep behavior consistent across the whole app.
