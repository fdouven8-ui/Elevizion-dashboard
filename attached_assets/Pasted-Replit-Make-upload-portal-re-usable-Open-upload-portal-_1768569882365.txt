Replit — Make upload portal re-usable: “Open upload portal” always available after onboarding (TEST_MODE-friendly)

What we want
We already tested the onboarding steps up to the upload step and it works.
Now we want to repeatedly test ONLY from the upload step onward (upload → validation → store → link → publish),
WITHOUT re-running the earlier onboarding steps every time.

Goal
After an advertiser reaches the upload step once, provide a permanent/re-usable way to open the upload portal again.

Required behavior

1) Store upload portal state on the advertiser
When onboarding reaches the upload phase successfully, persist on the advertiser:
- uploadEnabled = true
- uploadLinkKey (stable identifier) OR store lastUploadTokenId
- lastUploadGeneratedAt
This makes “upload portal available” a durable state, not a one-time email link.

2) Add “Open upload portal” button (admin + optionally advertiser view)
On advertiser detail (admin):
- Show a section “Video upload”
- If uploadEnabled=true:
  - Button: “Open upload portal”
  - Secondary: “Nieuwe uploadlink” (regenerate)
Clicking “Open upload portal” should:
- If there is an active, unexpired token for this advertiser uploadLinkKey:
  - reuse it (return the URL)
- Else:
  - generate a new token automatically (same logic as regenerate)
  - return the URL
Then open in new tab and copy to clipboard.

3) In TEST_MODE: make tokens effectively “never block testing”
In TEST_MODE:
- TTL = 30 days (already)
- Additionally, allow reusing an existing token even if it was previously used,
  OR generate a fresh one automatically without requiring any onboarding state checks.
The user should never be blocked by “invalid/expired” while testing upload flows.

4) Upload portal must accept both:
- token-based access (public)
AND
- admin-session access (optional but recommended)
Optional improvement:
If admin is logged in and TEST_MODE is true, allow:
- /upload?advertiserId=... (admin-only) which internally generates/reuses a token and redirects
This is NOT for public users, only to speed up testing.

5) Do not force earlier steps again
Once uploadEnabled=true, the upload system must NOT check:
- SEPA step completion
- package selection
- OTP completion
Those were already tested. The upload portal is now a repeatable test surface.

Acceptance criteria
- After completing onboarding once, admin can always open upload portal again from advertiser detail.
- No “Toegang geweigerd / verlopen link” blocks testing: it auto-regenerates.
- Upload validation + storage + linking + publish logic remains identical to real flow.
- Public users still only get token-based access; admin-only shortcuts are protected.
