We have a misleading situation: Yodeck confirms player=591896 is ONLINE and source_type=playlist source_id=30498772 with itemCount=4, but our UI screenshot shows "NO CONTENT" and proofStatus fails because screenshot metadata is null.

This is NOT a playlist push issue anymore. We must make screenshot/proof reliable.

Implement a minimal fix:

1) Add endpoint GET /api/screens/:id/proof that ALWAYS fetches a FRESH screenshot server-side and returns diagnostics.

Implementation details:
- Load screen by :id, get yodeckScreenshotUrl (currently dsbackend.s3...png). Also load yodeckPlayerId.
- Build urlWithBuster = `${yodeckScreenshotUrl}?t=${Date.now()}`
- Fetch screenshot bytes with:
  - headers: { "Cache-Control": "no-cache", "Pragma":"no-cache" }
  - timeout 10s
  - follow redirects
- Capture diagnostics:
  - httpStatus, contentType, contentLengthHeader
  - byteSize = buffer.length
  - sha256 hash of buffer
  - magicBytes = buffer.slice(0,16).toString('hex')
- Valid screenshot rules:
  - httpStatus must be 200
  - contentType must include image/png or image/jpeg
  - byteSize must be >= 10_000 (10KB). If smaller -> treat as placeholder/invalid.
- Store on screen row:
  - yodeckScreenshotLastOkAt = now (only if valid)
  - yodeckScreenshotByteSize
  - yodeckScreenshotHash
  - also store lastAttemptAt, lastAttemptStatus, lastAttemptByteSize, lastAttemptError (new fields OR reuse yodeckContentError-like field)
- Return JSON:
{
  ok: true/false,
  urlWithBuster,
  httpStatus,
  contentType,
  byteSize,
  hash,
  magicBytes,
  valid: true/false,
  reason: "too_small" | "bad_status" | "not_image" | "fetch_failed"
}

2) UI change (tiny):
- On screen detail page, add button "Ververs bewijs".
- It calls GET /api/screens/:id/proof.
- Then set <img src> to response.urlWithBuster to prevent browser caching.
- Show proof diagnostics in small text: byteSize, lastOkAt, reason if invalid.

3) Fix canonical parse bug:
- In CanonicalParse derived object, do NOT set layoutId=sourceId when source_type=playlist. layoutId must be null unless source_type=layout. Keep playlistId separate.

Acceptance:
- Calling /api/screens/:id/proof shows byteSize > 10KB and valid=true when screenshots work.
- If screenshots are placeholders, valid=false with reason=too_small, but playback status remains OK.
- UI no longer implies "no content" based on screenshot alone.

Do not refactor autopilot. This is purely proof/screenshot reliability.
