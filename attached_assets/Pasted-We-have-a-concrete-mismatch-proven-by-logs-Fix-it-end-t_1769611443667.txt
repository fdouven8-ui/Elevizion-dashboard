We have a concrete mismatch proven by logs. Fix it end-to-end so the physical Yodeck screens actually play content.

EVIDENCE (from logs)
- now-playing: playlistId=30498772, itemCount=0, verificationOk=false ("playlist leeg")
- content-status / PlaylistItems: playlistId=30461663 has 2 items
=> We are filling playlist 30461663 but the screen is assigned to 30498772 (empty). That’s why the screen shows no content.

GOAL
Each screen must have exactly ONE active per-screen playlist that is:
1) filled with baseline + ads
2) assigned to the Yodeck screen
3) pushed to device
4) verified by reading Yodeck (itemCount>0)
No more dual-playlist mismatch.

IMPLEMENT FIX (HARD)

1) Single playlist source of truth per screen
- Add/confirm screen.yodeckActivePlaylistId (or reuse existing field, but ONE field must be the truth).
- Determine active playlistId from Yodeck screen details (screen content source playlistId).
- Store it as yodeckActivePlaylistId.
- Stop using location.ads.playlistId as “the” playlist for playback.

2) Repair/sync must fill THE playlist the screen actually uses
Implement repairScreen(screenId):
- Fetch Yodeck screen details -> get actual assigned playlistId (A).
- Ensure baseline items list (from baseline template playlist) is non-empty, else injectFallback (must be playable).
- Collect ads for this screen from placements (only approved).
- Build finalItems = baselineItems + adItems.
- Write finalItems into playlistId A (clear & repopulate or reconcile).
- Push/Save to screen.
- Verify: fetch playlist items from Yodeck for playlistId A and require itemCount>0.
- Return diagnostics: playlistId, itemCount, baselineCount, adsCount, verificationOk, errorReason.

3) Fix now-playing endpoint to use playlistId truth
- now-playing must read playlistId from Yodeck (actual assigned) OR yodeckActivePlaylistId, not from legacy fields.
- itemCount must be fetched for that same playlistId.
- If itemCount==0, show error with reason + auto-suggest "Force repair".

4) Remove layout-mode confusion (we want simple playlist playback)
- For locations/screens in playlist-only mode:
  - Set location.layoutMode = "PLAYLIST" (or equivalent)
  - Do not require layout assignment.
- content-status must NOT show LAYOUT_NOT_ASSIGNED as “needsRepair” when we are in playlist-only mode.

5) Update the scheduled AutopilotWorker
- For each online screen:
  - call ensureScreenPlaylistFilled(screenId) which fills the active playlistId (from Yodeck)
  - verify itemCount>0
- If Yodeck is reachable and screen online but playlist empty -> auto-repair immediately.

ACCEPTANCE TEST (MUST PRINT REAL OUTPUT)
Pick screenId=241377ce-a25e-4744-9ea7-cd9359515d07:
- Call repairScreen
- Show that the playlistId used in now-playing is the same playlistId that gets filled
- now-playing after repair must return itemCount>0 and verificationOk=true
- Yodeck screen must stop showing NO CONTENT TO PLAY.
