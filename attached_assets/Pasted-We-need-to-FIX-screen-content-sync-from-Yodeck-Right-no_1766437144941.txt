We need to FIX “screen content” sync from Yodeck. Right now we import screens fine (name/status/screenshotUrl) but `yodeckContentCount` stays 0 and `yodeckContentSummary.items` stays empty, while the screen is actually playing content.

Goal:
- For each Yodeck screen/player in our DB, fetch what content is assigned/scheduled in Yodeck and store a usable summary:
  - yodeckContentStatus: "ok" | "empty" | "unknown" | "error"
  - yodeckContentCount: number
  - yodeckContentSummary: { playlists: [], items: [], topItems: [], lastFetchedAt }
  - yodeckContentLastFetchedAt
  - yodeckContentError (string if fails)

Important:
- We CANNOT rely on our own Placements yet (those are empty). This is purely: “what does Yodeck say is configured on that screen?”
- If Yodeck does not have an endpoint for “currently playing now”, we still want “assigned content” (playlist/layout/media scheduled) so we can show “this screen has X items”.

Implementation requirements:
1) Find our existing Yodeck integration code where we call:
   GET https://app.yodeck.com/api/v2/screens
   and where we currently set content = 0 items.
2) Extend the sync so AFTER screens are fetched, we ALSO fetch content info per screen/player.

Do it in a robust way:
- Add a small Yodeck API client helper with:
  - baseUrl = https://app.yodeck.com/api/v2
  - auth header using our stored apiKey (same as current)
  - request wrapper with timeout + error handling + logging

- Add a “probe” strategy to discover content endpoints safely:
  For each screen, try these endpoints in order (stop when one yields structured content):
  A) GET /screens/{yodeckPlayerId}
  B) GET /screens/{yodeckPlayerId}/playlists
  C) GET /screens/{yodeckPlayerId}/schedule
  D) GET /players/{yodeckPlayerId}
  E) GET /players/{yodeckPlayerId}/playlists
  F) GET /players/{yodeckPlayerId}/schedule
  G) GET /screens/{yodeckPlayerId}/media
  H) GET /players/{yodeckPlayerId}/media

Notes:
- yodeckPlayerId in our DB is the numeric string like "591896".
- Some endpoints may 404. That’s OK: catch and continue.
- When you get a response, normalize it:
  - If it contains playlists/layouts/media/items, extract “name/title/id/type” into `items[]`
  - Also extract playlists[] separately if possible.
  - Compute yodeckContentCount = items.length (or sum of playlist items if nested)
  - topItems = first 5 distinct by name
  - status:
    - "ok" if count > 0
    - "empty" if count == 0 but the endpoint was valid and returns empty lists
    - "unknown" if no endpoint worked but player is online and has screenshot
    - "error" if we got hard failures (5xx/timeout) consistently

3) Add a DEBUG route so I can see raw Yodeck responses quickly:
   GET /api/integrations/yodeck/debug-content/:playerId
   This should try the same endpoints above and return:
   {
     tried: [{path, ok, statusCode}],
     firstSuccess: {path, body} | null,
     normalized: {status, count, summary}
   }
   Protect it behind owner permission or DEV only (env NODE_ENV !== "production").

4) Update Control Room logic:
- If yodeckContentStatus = ok => “Speelt Yodeck content (X items)”
- If empty => “Geen content in Yodeck”
- If unknown but screenshot exists and screen online => “Speelt content (onbekend / unmanaged)”
- If error => show error message in actions (severity warning/error)

5) DB:
- Ensure the Screen model/table has fields we already output in /api/screens:
  yodeckContentStatus, yodeckContentCount, yodeckContentSummary (json), yodeckContentLastFetchedAt, yodeckContentError
- If missing, create a migration.

6) Tests / verification:
- Add logs during sync:
  “[Yodeck] Content probe for {playerName}({playerId}) success={path} count={n}”
- After sync, /api/screens should show non-zero content if Yodeck returns it.

Deliverables:
- Code changes + migration (if needed)
- The new debug endpoint
- Updated sync behavior
- No UI redesign needed; just make the data accurate.

Be careful with rate limits:
- If we have many screens later, do limited concurrency (e.g. p-limit 3-5) for content calls.
