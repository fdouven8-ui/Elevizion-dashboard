PROBLEM:
retry-publish fails with NO_TARGET_RESOLVED because it only resolves targets via SIGNED contracts:
advertiser -> contracts(0) -> placements(0) -> screens(0) -> locations(0) -> withPlaylist(0) -> mappings(0)
But for bootstrapping/testing (and even real ops), we must be able to publish to a specific screen even if contracts are not signed yet.

GOAL:
Add a safe, explicit fallback target resolution for POST /api/admin/video-review/:id/retry-publish:
- Prefer explicit target stored on the review item (if exists).
- Else allow admin to force a target via request body.
- Ensure intendedPlaylistId is resolved from that target (screen playlist "EVZ | SCREEN | <playerId>").
- Then run screen assignment + verification as already implemented.

IMPLEMENTATION:
1) In server/routes.ts handler POST /api/admin/video-review/:id/retry-publish (around line ~2713):
   - Accept optional JSON body:
     { yodeckScreenId?: number, yodeckPlayerId?: number }
   - Validate: at least one of these if contract-based resolution yields 0 targets.

2) Target resolution logic:
   A) Run existing resolution (contracts/placements) as-is.
   B) If it returns 0 targets:
      - If body.yodeckScreenId present: use that as sole target.
      - Else if body.yodeckPlayerId present:
         - Resolve yodeckScreenId by querying Yodeck screens list once OR use existing DB mapping if you store playerId->screenId.
         - If you already store yodeckPlayerId on our Screen model, use that mapping.
      - If still not resolved: keep NO_TARGET_RESOLVED but include debug showing forced inputs were absent/failed.

3) intendedPlaylistId resolution for forced target:
   - We already have per-screen playlists named "EVZ | SCREEN | <playerId>" (example: 591895, 591896).
   - Implement helper to find or fetch playlistId for that playerId WITHOUT creating new playlists.
   - If DB already stores yodeckPlaylistId for screen/player, use it.
   - Else search Yodeck playlists by name (exact match) and take its id.

4) Return fields:
   - intendedPlaylistId
   - targetScreenIds
   - screenAssignment[] verified
   - debug should include whether forcedTarget was used.

5) Keep constraints:
   - No new playlists created.
   - Do not require signed contracts for admin retry-publish when forced target provided.
   - This endpoint is admin-only, so forced targeting is acceptable.

ACCEPTANCE TEST:
From browser console:
fetch("/api/admin/video-review/9ed9ae02-4d42-426e-8492-a5c6375b7917/retry-publish",{
 method:"POST",
 headers:{ "Content-Type":"application/json" },
 body: JSON.stringify({ yodeckPlayerId: 591895 })
}).then(r=>r.json()).then(console.log)

Must return ok:true and screenAssignment[0].verified===true, with intendedPlaylistId not null.
