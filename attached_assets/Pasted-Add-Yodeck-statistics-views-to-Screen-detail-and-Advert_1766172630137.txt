Add Yodeck statistics views to Screen detail and Advertiser detail pages.
Stats must be filterable and support snapshots. Do not change other app behavior.

1) Data source
- Use Yodeck API as the source of truth for statistics (reporting/playback/uptime if available).
- Implement a backend service layer: yodeckStatsService
- If an endpoint is unavailable for the current Yodeck plan/API, show a friendly “Stats not available” state.

2) Screen detail page
- Add a “Statistieken” tab/section.
- Show:
  A) Uptime chart (online/offline over time) based on Yodeck device status/history if available
  B) Playback metrics if Yodeck provides them (total plays, duration)
  C) Optional: Top creatives on this screen (plays) when available
- Filters (compact bar above charts):
  - Date range: Today / 7d / 30d / Custom
  - Toggle: “Alleen actieve uren” (use global active hours setting)
  - Granularity: per day / per hour (when supported)
  - Refresh button
- Deep-link filters in URL query params.

3) Advertiser detail page
- Add a “Statistieken” tab/section.
- Show advertiser-level stats using Yodeck data mapping:
  - Total plays across all screens (if available)
  - Breakdown by screen, by city, and by creative (if available)
- Filters:
  - Date range: Today / 7d / 30d / Custom
  - Creative selector: All creatives / single creative
  - Screen/city filter (optional)

4) Mapping requirements (critical)
- Ensure we can map Yodeck entities to our dashboard entities:
  - Screens: map by Device name or tag containing EVZ-###
  - Creatives/Playlists/Campaigns: map to our “Placement” records via stored Yodeck IDs
- Store only the IDs needed for mapping (device_id, creative_id, playlist_id, etc.), not full stats logs.

5) Snapshots
- Add a “Snapshot” button in stats sections:
  - Captures the visible chart + selected filters + title (Screen/Advertiser name + date range)
  - Produces a PNG (client-side capture is fine)
- Add optional “Export PDF” if simple.
- Provide “Copy share link” that preserves filters.

6) Performance & caching
- Do not store full stats history in DB.
- Use short-lived caching (e.g., 5–15 minutes) for API responses to avoid rate limits.
- Allow manual refresh to bypass cache.

7) UI rules
- Keep stats UI clean and secondary (not overwhelming).
- Show loading skeleton while fetching.
- Show friendly empty state when no data.

Goal:
When I click a Screen or Advertiser, I can immediately view Yodeck-based statistics, filter them, and create shareable snapshots—without building a heavy analytics warehouse.
