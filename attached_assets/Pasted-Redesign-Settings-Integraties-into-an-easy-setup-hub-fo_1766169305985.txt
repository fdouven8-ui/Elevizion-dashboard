Redesign Settings > Integraties into an easy setup hub for all API connections.
Goal: I can configure everything here without technical knowledge.

1) Integrations included:
- Yodeck
- Moneybird
- Dropbox Sign
(Keep it extendable for future integrations.)

2) For each integration, provide a simple setup section with:
- Enable toggle
- Required credentials inputs (API keys / IDs)
- “Test verbinding” button that validates credentials and shows a clear result:
  - Green: Connected
  - Red: Not connected + human-readable error message
- Sync options (checkboxes) + sync frequency selector (simple)
- “Sync nu” button

3) Replace developer-style tips with user-friendly guidance:
- Show exactly what to paste where.
- Show copy buttons for URLs/IDs (e.g., OAuth callback URL)
- Provide 2–3 troubleshooting bullets when failing.
- Provide a “Copy error details” button for support/developer.

4) Status display:
Each integration card should show:
- Status badge: Niet ingesteld / Verbonden / Fout
- Last sync time (human readable, e.g. “2 uur geleden”)
- Items processed (optional)
- Buttons: Instellen, Test, Sync nu

5) Yodeck specific requirements:
- Add a setting “ScreenID mapping method”:
  - Device name contains EVZ-###
  - Device tag field (screen_id)
- Validate that devices can be matched to our Screen IDs.

6) Moneybird specific requirements:
- Show required fields used by our implementation (client id/secret/admin id).
- Provide a copyable callback URL if OAuth is used.
- Allow choosing what to sync (contacts, invoices status, payments).

7) Dropbox Sign specific requirements:
- Store API key and template IDs (contract + SEPA).
- Toggle: store signed PDFs in our storage (recommended).
- Track webhook status (optional simple indicator).

8) Security:
- Do NOT display full secrets once saved (mask them).
- Allow “Replace key” flow.
- Store secrets securely (prefer env vars or encrypted storage).
- Ensure only Eigenaar (admin) can access Integrations settings.

9) UI constraints:
- Keep the page clean and quick.
- No large technical paragraphs.
- Everything should feel like a setup wizard.

Outcome:
Integrations tab becomes a simple “connect and verify” setup hub for all APIs.
