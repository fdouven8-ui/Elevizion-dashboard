Implement Yodeck API integration using the "screens" resource (based on the provided Yodeck screen JSON sample).

1) Base URL and endpoints
- Use Yodeck API v2 endpoints.
- Implement these server routes:
  - POST /api/integrations/yodeck/test
    -> calls Yodeck "list screens" endpoint and expects JSON array.
    -> success returns { ok:true, count:<number>, sampleFields:["id","uuid","name","workspace.name","state.online"] }
  - POST /api/integrations/yodeck/sync-screens
    -> pulls list of screens and upserts into our DB table screens_external (or existing screens table if appropriate)
  - GET /api/yodeck/screens (admin only)
    -> returns cached/last-synced screen list from DB for UI.

2) Authentication header
- Read token from process.env.YODECK_API_KEY.
- It must already be in the format "<label>:<token_value>" (e.g. "elevizion:XXXX").
- Send request header exactly:
  Authorization: `Token ${process.env.YODECK_API_KEY}`
- Also send:
  Accept: application/json

3) JSON validation + errors
- If response content-type is not application/json, treat as error and return 502 with:
  { message, requestedUrl, status, contentType, bodyPreview }
- Only return HTTP 200 from our API when Yodeck returns valid JSON.

4) Mapping to Elevizion Screen IDs
- We must map Yodeck screen to our SCREEN_ID format (EVZ-###).
- Preferred mapping order:
  A) If screen.basic.tags contains a tag matching /^EVZ-\d{3}$/ -> use that as SCREEN_ID
  B) Else if screen.name contains "EVZ-###" -> parse it
  C) Else store SCREEN_ID as null and mark as "unmapped" in UI.
- Store Yodeck identifiers:
  - yodeck_screen_id (numeric id)
  - yodeck_uuid
  - workspace name/id
  - screenshot_url
  - state.online, state.last_seen
  - working_hours_config (optional JSON)
- Do NOT store huge network config fields unless needed.

5) UI (Settings > Integraties > Yodeck)
- Add buttons:
  - Test verbinding
  - Sync schermen
- After Test: show count + basic info
- After Sync: show “X screens synced” and update lastSync time.

6) UI (Schermen page)
- Add columns:
  - SCREEN_ID (mapped)
  - Yodeck name
  - Workspace (location)
  - Online status
  - Last seen
- Filters:
  - by place/workspace name
  - by online/offline
  - by SCREEN_ID

7) Keep it simple
- Focus only on screens list + status first.
- Stats/playback endpoints come later.

Acceptance criteria:
- POST /api/integrations/yodeck/test returns 200 and JSON with count (no HTML).
- Sync imports screens and the UI can filter by location/workspace.
- Mapping finds EVZ-### from tags or name.
