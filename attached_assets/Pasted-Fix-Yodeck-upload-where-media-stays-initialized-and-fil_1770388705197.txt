Fix Yodeck upload where media stays initialized and fileSize=0 after PUT.

Current behavior:
- Create media succeeds -> mediaId returned.
- get_upload_url present.
- Code logs "Uploading 1954184 bytes..." and "Upload complete" but polling shows status=initialized, fileSize=0 for 20 polls then fails.

Conclusion:
- The binary upload never actually lands in Yodeck storage OR we are PUT-ing to the wrong URL.
- We must hard-verify the presigned upload step and ensure we GET the real presigned upload_url if required.

Tasks (minimal, no refactor):
1) In transactionalUploadService (or wherever UPLOAD_TO_YODECK does upload):
   - Ensure we do:
     a) POST /api/v2/media -> returns media object with get_upload_url
     b) GET get_upload_url -> response JSON MUST contain { upload_url: "<presigned PUT url>" }
        - If GET response does not contain upload_url, log full body and fail.
     c) PUT binary to upload_url (the presigned URL), NOT to get_upload_url.
2) Harden PUT verification:
   - Use fetch/undici with:
     - method: PUT
     - headers: Content-Type: video/mp4
     - header: Content-Length: <exact bytes>
   - Treat success ONLY if status is 200 or 204.
   - On non-200/204: log status + first 500 chars of body + response headers (esp. x-amz-request-id / cf-ray / etag) then fail.
3) Add logging (no secrets):
   - Log GET get_upload_url endpoint path (not query)
   - Log presigned upload_url host (e.g., r2/cloudfront/s3) and path (strip query)
   - Log PUT response status and ETag header if present
   - Log bytes sent and content-length
4) After PUT success:
   - Immediately GET /media/{id} once and log fileSize/status BEFORE polling.
   - Then poll as before.
5) Timeout/polling:
   - Keep current polling, but if fileSize stays 0 and status stays initialized for N polls, return error with diagnostics:
     - putStatus, uploadUrlHost, usedGetUploadUrl (true/false)

Acceptance:
- After PUT, /media/{id} shows fileSize > 0 within a short time or at least transitions out of initialized.
- normalize-and-publish no longer fails with fileSize=0.
