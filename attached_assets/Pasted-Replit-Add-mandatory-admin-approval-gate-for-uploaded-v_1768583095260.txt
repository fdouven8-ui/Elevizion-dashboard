Replit — Add mandatory admin approval gate for uploaded videos + auto publish after approval

Goal
Every uploaded advertiser video must be manually reviewed by admin.
Only after admin clicks “Goedkeuren” the system may publish the ad to the screens selected by the system.
No video may auto-publish immediately after upload.

Core states
Introduce/standardize video/ad asset status:
- UPLOADED (file received, not reviewed)
- IN_REVIEW (optional alias of UPLOADED)
- APPROVED (admin approved)
- REJECTED (admin rejected, requires re-upload)
- PUBLISHED (successfully placed on screens)

Required changes

1) After upload: always mark as UPLOADED (not approved)
- When upload finishes + validations pass:
  - persist the asset record
  - set status = UPLOADED
  - store metadata (duration, resolution, codec, filesize, originalFilename, storedFilename)
- Show UI message to advertiser/admin:
  “Bedankt! We controleren je video en zetten hem daarna live.”

2) Admin review queue page
Add a new admin page:
- /review (or /video-review)
It shows a table/list of assets with status UPLOADED, newest first:
Columns:
- Advertiser name
- PackageType (SINGLE/TRIPLE/TEN)
- Selected cities/targeting summary
- Upload time
- Technical checks summary (duration/resolution/codec OK)
Actions per row:
- Preview (open modal/player)
- Goedkeuren
- Afkeuren

3) Preview for admin
In the review page (and advertiser detail):
- Show video player preview (stream from storage via secured signed URL or existing token access)
- Show technical metadata (duration, resolution, codec)

4) Approve action triggers auto publish
When admin clicks “Goedkeuren”:
- Update asset status -> APPROVED (store approvedAt, approvedBy)
- Immediately enqueue publish workflow for this advertiser:
  - create/refresh placement plan using the existing placement engine
  - set publishQueue status PROPOSED (or your current state)
  - if you already have APPROVE->PUBLISH pipeline: trigger it now
Important: publishing must use the already chosen screens/regions from the onboarding/package selection logic.
If capacity changed, reuse your existing resimulate-before-publish rule and show warning if it can’t be placed.

5) Reject action + reason + reupload loop
When admin clicks “Afkeuren”:
- Require a short reason (dropdown + optional text), e.g.:
  - Onleesbare tekst / kwaliteit
  - Verkeerde duur
  - Niet toegestaan (inhoud)
  - Anders
- Update asset status -> REJECTED (store rejectedAt, rejectedReason)
- Send an automatic email to advertiser with the reason + upload link to reupload
- The advertiser can upload again; the new asset becomes UPLOADED and appears in review queue.

6) UI: advertiser detail status
On advertiser detail page show a clear badge:
- Video: Niet geüpload / In review / Goedgekeurd / Afgekeurd / Live
Also show the last rejection reason if REJECTED.

7) Safety
- Block publish worker from publishing assets unless status is APPROVED (or PUBLISHED)
- Even in TEST_MODE, keep the approval gate ON (unless admin explicitly chooses to bypass for testing).

Acceptance criteria
- Upload does NOT publish automatically.
- Admin can preview and approve.
- Approving triggers placement/publish automatically to the screens the system selects.
- Rejecting sends reason and allows reupload.
- Publish pipeline refuses non-approved assets.
Minimal changes; integrate with existing placement engine + publish queue.
