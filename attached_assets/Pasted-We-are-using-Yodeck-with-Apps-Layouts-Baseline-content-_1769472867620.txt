We are using Yodeck with Apps + Layouts. 
Baseline content (news, weather) already exists as Yodeck Apps and is used inside a Layout.

CURRENT PROBLEM:
Autopilot incorrectly tries to seed baseline content by searching Yodeck media ("news", "weather", "self-ad"),
which fails because news/weather are Apps, not media uploads.
This causes empty baseline playlists and broken screens.

NEW REQUIRED ARCHITECTURE (MANDATORY):
1) Baseline content MUST be handled via a fixed Yodeck Layout, NOT via playlists or media seeding.
2) Advertisements MUST be handled via ADS playlists only.
3) Autopilot must ensure:
   - correct Layout is active on the screen
   - ADS playlist exists and is linked to the layout
   - approved ads from DB are present in ADS playlist

IMPLEMENTATION:

A) Baseline Layout
- Define a single baseline layout name, e.g.:
  BASELINE_LAYOUT_NAME = "Elevizion Baseline"
- This layout already contains:
  - News App
  - Weather App
  - Any fixed branding
- Autopilot MUST NOT try to create or search for news/weather media anymore.

B) Autopilot flow per location/screen:
1) Resolve Yodeck screen/player ID
2) Ensure baseline layout is active on the screen:
   - If another layout is active → switch to BASELINE_LAYOUT_NAME
3) Ensure ADS playlist exists for the location
4) Ensure ADS playlist is linked to the layout (zone/playlist slot)
5) Fetch approved ads from database for that location
6) Add ads to ADS playlist (idempotent, no duplicates)

C) Remove/disable:
- FindMedia("news")
- FindMedia("weather")
- Baseline media seeding logic
- Any logic that requires uploading baseline media

D) Error handling:
- If baseline layout does not exist → fail with BASELINE_LAYOUT_MISSING
- UI must show one clear message:
  "Baseline layout ontbreekt in Yodeck. Maak layout 'Elevizion Baseline' aan."
- Do NOT show "upload dit item eerst" anymore.

E) UI changes (Dashboard):
- Replace "Geen basis content" warning with:
  - Layout status: OK / Missing
  - ADS playlist status: X items
- Remove dependency on "Repareer scherm" for baseline
- Autopilot runs automatically when:
  - screen becomes online
  - ad is approved
  - worker periodic check

ACCEPTANCE:
- New screen with no ads still shows news & weather (via layout)
- Approved ads appear automatically without manual action
- No screen can ever be empty
- Autopilot logs clearly show:
  - Layout active
  - ADS playlist linked
  - Ads count
