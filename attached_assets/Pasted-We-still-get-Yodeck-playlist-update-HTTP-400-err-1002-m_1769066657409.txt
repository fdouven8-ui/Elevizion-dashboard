We still get Yodeck playlist update HTTP 400 err_1002 missing_key="id".
Logs show:
- PLAYLIST_GET firstItemKeys = id,priority,duration,name,type
- newItemKeys = media,type,duration,priority (no id)
=> This Yodeck endpoint requires every item to have an id, meaning it DOES NOT create new items via full update.

FIX: Add new playlist item via a CREATE endpoint (POST) that returns an item id, then optionally reorder.

TASK:

1) Keep current GET playlist logging, but change the implementation:

2) Add "create playlist item" step:
- Find the correct Yodeck API v2 endpoint to create a playlist item.
  Try in this order (stop when one works):
  A) POST https://app.yodeck.com/api/v2/playlists/{playlistId}/items
  B) POST https://app.yodeck.com/api/v2/playlists/{playlistId}/items/
  C) POST https://app.yodeck.com/api/v2/playlist_items
     with body including playlist reference (playlist: playlistId) + media + type + duration + priority
  D) If GET playlist response includes a link like items_url or related.items, use that.

- Payload should match the existing item schema as closely as possible.
  Use GET playlist first item as template:
  existingItemExample keys: id, priority, duration, name, type
  New item should set:
    type: "media"
    media: <mediaId>   (if required by API)
    duration: <default or from asset>
    priority: nextPriority
    name: (optional) set to file name if allowed, otherwise omit

- After POST, parse returned JSON and extract createdItemId.

3) Only after the item is created:
- Optionally reorder priorities by fetching playlist again and PATCH/PUT existing items INCLUDING their id fields.
- When updating existing items, ensure payload items include id for ALL entries.

4) Make it backwards compatible:
- If POST create endpoint not found/returns 404, log a clear error:
  "No playlist item create endpoint found" with status+body.
- Do NOT attempt full update that would create items (it will keep failing missing id).

5) Logging:
- Log:
  PLAYLIST_ITEM_CREATE endpoint=... status=... bodySnippet=...
  createdItemId=...
- If reorder performed:
  PLAYLIST_REORDER status=...

6) Update error codes:
- If create fails: lastErrorCode = YODECK_PLAYLIST_ITEM_CREATE_FAILED
- If reorder fails: lastErrorCode = YODECK_PLAYLIST_REORDER_FAILED
- Also fix the stale lastErrorCode currently stuck on YODECK_UPLOAD_FAILED.

ACCEPTANCE:
- Retry publishes successfully:
  - upload ok (or already uploaded)
  - create playlist item returns 200/201 and yields item id
  - plan transitions to PUBLISHED (not FAILED)
- No more missing_key "id".
