Build a production-ready web app called “Elevizion Dashboard” (MVP).
Goal: one central dashboard to manage advertisers, locations, screens, campaigns/schedules, billing status, and revenue-share (10%).

Tech requirements

Use Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript

UI: TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui

Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM

Auth: NextAuth (email/password or magic link is fine)

Hosting-ready for Replit, but code must be portable to any VPS later.

Provide a clear README with local dev + deployment steps.

Data model (Prisma)

Implement these entities (minimum fields):

User: id, email, name, role (“admin”, “viewer”), createdAt

Advertiser: id, companyName, contactName, email, phone, status (“active”, “paused”), monthlyPriceExVat, createdAt

Location (partner business): id, name, address, contactName, email, phone, revenueSharePercent (default 10), createdAt

Screen: id, locationId, name, yodeckPlayerId (nullable), status (“online”, “offline”, “unknown”), lastSeenAt (nullable), createdAt

Campaign: id, advertiserId, name, startDate, endDate, status (“active”, “ended”, “scheduled”), createdAt

Placement (campaign ↔ screens): id, campaignId, screenId, secondsPerLoop, playsPerHour, createdAt

Invoice: id, advertiserId, periodStart, periodEnd, amountExVat, amountIncVat, status (“draft”, “sent”, “paid”, “overdue”, “failed”), moneybirdInvoiceId (nullable), createdAt

Payout (revenue share): id, locationId, periodStart, periodEnd, grossRevenueExVat, sharePercent, payoutAmountExVat, status (“pending”, “paid”), createdAt

Add proper relations + indexes.

Core pages (MVP)

Create these pages with a left sidebar navigation:

Overview: KPIs (MRR, active advertisers, active screens, unpaid invoices, total payouts due).

Screens: table of screens with filters by location + status. Screen detail shows placements that run on it.

Advertisers: table + create/edit form. Advertiser detail shows campaigns + invoices.

Locations: table + create/edit form. Location detail shows screens + payouts.

Campaigns: create campaign + assign to screens (create placements).

Billing: invoices list + status badges + “mark as paid” button (MVP local only).

Payouts: generate payouts per month from invoices and placements (simple logic below).

MVP business logic

MRR = sum(monthlyPriceExVat) of active advertisers

A campaign is “active” if today is between startDate and endDate (inclusive).

A screen “status” is manual for now (online/offline/unknown), editable.

Revenue share logic (simple MVP):

For a given month, compute total invoice revenue (Ex VAT) from advertisers.

Distribute revenue to locations proportionally by how many active placements they had that month:

placementCountPerLocation / totalPlacementCount

payoutAmountExVat = grossRevenueExVat * (sharePercent/100)

Store payouts in Payout table. Provide “Generate payouts for {month}” button.

Integrations (stub for now)

Create an “Integrations” settings page (even if minimal) with:

Moneybird API token fields (store encrypted or at least env vars)

Yodeck API token fields
But for MVP, do not call external APIs yet—only show “Connected: not configured / configured”.

UX requirements

Use clean cards + tables, good spacing.

Add search inputs on main tables.

Use toast notifications for create/update actions.

Include seed data script (Prisma) so the dashboard is populated on first run.

Deliverables

Working app with all pages + CRUD.

Prisma schema + migrations.

Seed script.

README with setup steps.

Start by scaffolding the project, then implement database + auth, then pages in this order: Overview → Advertisers → Locations → Screens → Campaigns → Billing → Payouts → Integrations.
