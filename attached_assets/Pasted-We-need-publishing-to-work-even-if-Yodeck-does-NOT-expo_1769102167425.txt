We need publishing to work even if Yodeck does NOT expose a POST endpoint to create playlist items.
Current fact from logs:
- GET playlist returns items with keys: id, priority, duration, name, type
- PUT update requires id for ALL items -> cannot create new items via full update

IMPLEMENT A ROBUST FALLBACK: "placeholder slot replacement".

A) Define placeholders
1) We will use pre-created placeholder items in each playlist.
2) Identify placeholder items by one of:
   - item.name startsWith "ELEVIZION_SLOT"
   - OR item.name contains "SLOT"
   - OR (if name not reliable) use duration==1 and type=="media" and maybe name=="Empty" (configurable)
3) Add config constants:
   PLACEHOLDER_PREFIX="ELEVIZION_SLOT"
   MIN_PLACEHOLDER_SLOTS=20  (target number of slots per playlist)

B) Publish algorithm for adding media to playlist
1) Always do PLAYLIST_GET first.
2) Try CREATE approach first (optional):
   - Attempt POST create playlist item (if endpoint exists).
   - If status is 404/405 or HTML Not Found -> treat as "not supported" and switch to fallback.

3) Fallback: replace an existing placeholder item (guaranteed to have id)
   - Find the first placeholder item in playlist.items that is not already used by this mediaId.
   - If found:
       - Build an UPDATE payload that keeps `id` and required fields.
       - Update that item so it points to the new media:
         - if item schema supports "media": set item.media = mediaId
         - ensure item.type="media"
         - set item.duration = desiredDuration
         - set item.priority = nextPriority or keep order
       - Send the update using the correct Yodeck endpoint for updating an item (not the whole playlist if possible).
         If there is no item-specific endpoint, do full playlist update but keep ids for ALL items and just change that one item.

4) If NO placeholder exists:
   - Return a clear error:
     YODECK_NO_PLACEHOLDER_SLOT
     message: "No ELEVIZION_SLOT items available. Create placeholders in Yodeck playlist first."
   - Do NOT keep retrying endlessly.

C) Optional helper to bootstrap placeholders (admin tool)
1) Add an admin-only checklist page or endpoint that tells:
   - playlistId
   - placeholderSlotsFound
   - placeholderSlotsNeeded
2) Provide instructions: "Create N items in Yodeck UI named ELEVIZION_SLOT_01..ELEVIZION_SLOT_20"

D) Logging + correctness
1) Logs must show which path was taken:
   - PLAYLIST_ITEM_CREATE supported/not supported
   - PLACEHOLDER_REPLACE used itemId=... oldName=... newMediaId=...
2) Fix stale errors:
   - If upload succeeded, do not leave lastErrorCode = YODECK_UPLOAD_FAILED.
   - On any failure, set lastErrorCode to the real step:
     YODECK_PLAYLIST_ITEM_CREATE_FAILED / YODECK_PLACEHOLDER_REPLACE_FAILED / YODECK_NO_PLACEHOLDER_SLOT

ACCEPTANCE:
- Publish succeeds without needing POST create endpoint.
- Playlist update no longer throws missing_key "id".
- Logs clearly show placeholder replacement with itemId.
