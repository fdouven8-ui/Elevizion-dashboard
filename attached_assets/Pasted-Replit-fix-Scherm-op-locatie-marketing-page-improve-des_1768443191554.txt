Replit — fix “Scherm op locatie” marketing page: improve design + ensure logo is clearly visible

Problem (as seen on /scherm-op-locatie)
- The page doesn’t look premium yet (contrast/typography feels off).
- The Elevizion logo is not clearly visible on this page (looks missing/too small/low contrast).
- The hero headline is hard to read against the dark background (text blends in).

Goal
Make this page visually strong and consistent with the rest of the site, and ensure the Elevizion logo is ALWAYS visible and recognizable.

Required changes

1) Ensure logo is visible (navbar + page)
- Use the shared Logo component (the new transparent PNG) in the navbar/header on this page.
- Make sure the logo has enough contrast:
  - If the header background is light, logo can be normal.
  - If the hero/header area is dark, force a header style that keeps logo readable (e.g. white header or a semi-opaque header background).
- Increase logo size in the navbar slightly on desktop and keep it readable on mobile.
- Confirm the logo renders on this route (no conditional rendering that hides it on certain pages).

2) Fix hero readability (big issue)
Right now the H1 looks dark on a dark background.
- Set hero H1 text color to high-contrast (white or near-white).
- Ensure subtitle text is also readable (lighter white/gray).
- If needed, add a subtle dark overlay on the hero background to guarantee readability.

3) Improve page layout so it feels “mooi” (premium marketing)
- Align hero content nicely (centered is fine, but spacing must feel intentional).
- Increase vertical padding in hero (but avoid too tall on small screens).
- Keep consistent max-widths (e.g. max-w-3xl for text).
- Make CTA button stand out with consistent brand styling and hover state.

4) Mobile perfect
- On mobile: reduce hero height and font sizes slightly, keep everything centered.
- Ensure no overflow/horizontal scroll.
- Navbar collapses cleanly; logo remains visible and not pushed away.
- CTA button should be full-width or near full-width on mobile.

5) Do not change copy/logic
- This is purely UI/UX and branding polish.
- Keep existing text, routes, and CTA actions the same.

Verification checklist
- Open /scherm-op-locatie on desktop: logo is clearly visible in header.
- H1 and subtitle are readable (no blending).
- Open on mobile: logo still visible, hero looks clean, CTA is easy to tap.
- No layout jumps, no horizontal scrolling.

Implement by editing the page component and the shared header/navbar component used on this route.
