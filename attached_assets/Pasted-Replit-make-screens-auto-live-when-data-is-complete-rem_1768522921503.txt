Replit — make screens auto-live when data is complete (remove need for manual “Zet live”)

Problem
The current “Zet live” button is redundant.
In this product, a screen should automatically be live for ads once all required data is present.
Manual activation causes confusion and empty marketing flows.

Goal
Automatically set readyForAds = true when a screen becomes valid,
and only require manual action to PAUSE ads (not to enable them).

Required changes

1) Define “auto-live” conditions
A screen is automatically ready for ads when:
- status === "active"
- AND (city OR regionCode is filled)
- AND yodeckScreenId IS NOT NULL

2) Automatic readyForAds logic
Implement server-side logic so that:
- Whenever a screen is created or updated
- AND all conditions above are met
→ readyForAds is automatically set to true

This should happen:
- on PATCH /api/locations/:id
- on Yodeck mapping updates
- on initial creation if data is already complete

3) Manual override = pause only
- Keep readyForAds as a field, but treat FALSE as an explicit pause by admin.
- If admin manually sets readyForAds=false, do NOT auto-enable again
  unless admin explicitly re-enables it.

4) Remove “Zet live” button from UI
- Remove the “Zet live” button from the Scherm detail page.
- Replace it with:
  - Toggle: “Advertenties pauzeren” (maps to readyForAds=false)
  - Default state is ON when auto-live conditions are met.

5) Add clear status indicator
On the Scherm detail page header, show a badge:
- “Live voor advertenties” (green) → readyForAds=true
- “Niet live — ontbrekende gegevens” (amber) → auto-live conditions not met
- “Gepauzeerd” (gray) → readyForAds=false manually

Optionally show a small checklist:
- Plaats ingevuld ✓/✗
- Yodeck gekoppeld ✓/✗
- Status actief ✓/✗

6) Safety & consistency
- Keep availabilityService logic unchanged.
- Auto-live must invalidate availability cache when triggered.
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing records.

Acceptance criteria
- Screens become visible in /api/regions/active automatically once data is complete.
- No manual “Zet live” action is required.
- Admin can still pause ads explicitly.
- Marketing flow never shows “geen schermen” when valid screens exist.
