Replit — fix “Ik wil adverteren” start flow (must show pricing first, not auto-select 3 screens)

Problem
When I click the main CTA button “Ik wil adverteren”, the app immediately navigates into the start/onboarding menu as if the user already selected the “3 schermen” package. This is wrong.

Goal
The “Ik wil adverteren” CTA must always land on the package/pricing selection view first (the screen where prices/packages are shown), WITHOUT preselecting any package.

Required behavior
1) Clicking “Ik wil adverteren” should route to the pricing/packages step (e.g. /start or /start/advertiseren — whichever is the correct route in this app).
2) On that page:
   - No package is preselected by default.
   - The user must actively choose a package (1 / 3 / 10).
   - Only AFTER a package is selected, the flow continues to the next step (region/city selection etc.).
3) If we currently pass a query param/state that sets default package (e.g. package=TRIPLE, screens=3, tier=3), remove it from the CTA link and remove any default selection logic.
4) If the pricing screen already exists, ensure the CTA links to that exact component/step.
5) Make sure the internal state initializes as:
   - selectedPackage = null
   - requiredScreens = 0 until selectedPackage is set
   - any “insufficient capacity (x/y)” message should not appear until a package is selected (or show a neutral hint like “Kies eerst een pakket”).

Implementation steps
- Find the “Ik wil adverteren” button/link (likely on landing page header/hero).
- Remove any hardcoded selection or navigation to a deeper step that assumes 3 screens.
- Update routing so it always goes to the pricing/packages selection step.
- In the pricing/packages component:
  - Ensure it does NOT default to TRIPLE/3.
  - Ensure the next step is gated: user cannot proceed until a package is chosen.

Acceptance criteria
- Clicking “Ik wil adverteren” always shows the pricing/packages first.
- No package is selected by default.
- The user must click a package to continue.
- The flow never behaves as if “3 screens” was chosen unless the user explicitly picks it.
- Add a quick manual test checklist in the PR notes: CTA → pricing visible → select 1/3/10 works → then city selector step.
No unrelated refactors.
